Outline:

Register for an API key from Garmin Connect and familiarize yourself with their API documentation.

Use the requests library in Python to make API calls to Garmin Connect, and use the json() method to parse the response into a Python dictionary.

Use the gspread library to interact with the Google Sheets API and write the data to the desired cell.

Use FastAPI to build an endpoint to trigger the above steps.

Set up a scheduler (like APScheduler or schedule) to run your script automatically on a set schedule.
